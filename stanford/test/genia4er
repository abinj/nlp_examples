Number of glucocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes and their sensitivity to hormone action.
The study demonstrated a decreased level of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) in peripheral blood lymphocytes from hypercholesterolemic subjects, and an elevated level in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
On the other hand, a decreased GR number resulted in a less efficient dexamethasone inhibition of the incorporation of labeled compounds.
